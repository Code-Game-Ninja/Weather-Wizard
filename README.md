### 🔐 Use Your Own API Key (WeatherAPI)

This project uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch real-time weather data.

> ⚠️ **Please register and use your own API key.**

#### How to set it up:

1. Go to [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and create a free account.
2. After signing in, you'll find your API key in your dashboard.
3. In the project folder, open the `script.js` file.
4. Replace the placeholder API key:
   ```js
   const apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
   ```
   with your actual API key:
   ```js
   const apiKey = "your-real-api-key";
   ```

✅ Do **not** commit your personal API key if you're pushing your code to a public repo!
